# Cursor

*AUCT.us is just a humble fork of [Cursor](https://cursor.com).* As you should guess, **Cursor** is not free, but if you are serious about code and AI, you are probably really going to want [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/pricing).

At AUCT.us, we are giant fans of [AI-first thinking used by the Cursor founders](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oFfVt3S51T4) and consider [Cursor tab](https://docs.cursor.com/tab/overview), [Cursor chat](https://docs.cursor.com/chat/overview), [Cursor CMD K](https://docs.cursor.com/cmdk/overview) along with [Cursor Context](https://docs.cursor.com/context/codebase-indexing) and [Cursor Advanced](https://docs.cursor.com/advanced/models) features to give us an early indication why Cursor will be THE code editor built from the ground up for programming with AI. Creating new posts on [the forum](https://forum.cursor.com/) for bugs or feature requests is much appreciated by the Cursor team.
